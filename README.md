# smartphone_decimeter


The goal of this competition is to compute smartphones location down to the decimeter or even centimeter resolution which could enable services that require lane-level accuracy such as HOV lane ETA estimation. You'll develop a model based on raw location measurements from Android smartphones collected in opensky and light urban roads using datasets collected by the host.


Your work will help produce more accurate positions, bridging the connection between the geospatial information of finer human behavior and mobile internet with improved granularity. As a result, new navigation methods could be built upon the more precise data.
